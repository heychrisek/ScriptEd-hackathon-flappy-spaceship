# flappy-spaceship

This was a project built by high school students from CRHS at the ScriptEd hackathon. Using the [Phaser game framework](http://phaser.io/), we built a Flappy Bird clone from [this tutorial](blog.lessmilk.com/how-to-make-flappy-bird-in-html5-1/), using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Phaser. The project was originally built on Cloud9, then downloaded and pushed to Github.
